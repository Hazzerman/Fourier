# Fourier
An interactive visualization of the Fourier Transform featured in 3Blue1Brown's video.

It is compiled into a runnable jar file written in Java using libraries from Eclipse, JFree Charts, and a Complex Numbers class. It showcases the ideas outlined by 3Blue1Brown, like wrapping, the displacement in the fourier, and uncertainty principles in the fourier transform. 
I am a programmer, so this is not very optimized, in fact the only optimizations I really did was working with scaling how many points are displayed in the circle, wrapped graph and only using a handful of points to calculate average weights rather than all of them or trying to use integration.
If enough people are interested, I can upload related libraries and the actual code, but I just thought I would put this out there because it is really useful in getting an understanding of how fourier transforms and such work.
Enjoy!
